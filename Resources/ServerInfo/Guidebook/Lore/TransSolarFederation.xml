Founded in 2298 after months of chaos following the dissolution of the United Nations of Earth, the [bold]TSF[/bold] promised to uphold order and bring in a new age of prosperity for the human race among the stars.
With their capital in the city of Caligo Prime on the planet of Mars, a close neighbor to the Nature World of Earth (alternative names include Terra or Gaia), they have one of the highest
influence over life in the entire Milky Way.

Even though the [bold]TSF[/bold] was powerful enough as is, with the dissolution of Nanotrasen as a corporate entity following attempts to repair their
irreparable status and brand following the Great Corporate War they provided shelter to high-value NT scientists (the ones that were left, anyway), paving way for the re-discovery of old technological marvels of the UNE-era.

Their accomplishments, even if very strategically-important, are hardly ever appreciated by the spoiled populace of Sol,
used to the prosperous economy of the UNE and near-utopian technology, whose standards are set higher than whatever the [bold]TSF[/bold] can ever provide.

The [bold]TSF[/bold] is lead by the President, which is elected every 10 years, serving as the executive branch of the government.

While the industrial and subsequent military powers of the [bold]TSF[/bold] may seem overwhelming at first, one must realize that open warfare beside PMC meddling actually directed by Humans was
rare during times of the UNE... which means that the [bold]TSF Navy[/bold] and [bold]Marine Corps[/bold] often rely mostly on theory for their tactics and hypotheticals on their strategy.
While this may seem laughable to most war-loving factions or species, do not ever underestimate how fast people (especially Humans) adapt.

The Department of Ground and Space Warfare, a deparment in the Trans-Solarian [bold]Federation[/bold] Science Cabinet, was founded shortly after the dawn of the TSF,
the GaSW is responsible for running combat simulations and developing/rediscovering the concerns of tactics,
strategy and logistics on a battlefield after the years of relative peace (as in violent conflict did not include humans fighting).

A fully militarized [bold]Federation[/bold] would be a force to be reckoned with, and most major factions know that, utilizing insurgents forces and surprise attacks. Even though this isn't the [bold]only reason...[/bold]

The [bold]Federation[/bold] values productivity, personal ambition, and economic power, reinforcing a belief that
success comes only to the hardest workers.

Despite the [bold]Federation[/bold]'s attempts at unity, dissent simmers beneath the surface. Various fringe
groups, insurgents, and ideological rivals like the [bold][color=brown]USSP[/bold][/color] and [bold][color=#8B0000]Phaethon Dynasty[/bold][/color] oppose the [bold]TSF's[/bold] control,
though open rebellion is rare due to the [bold]Federation[/bold]'s overwhelming power in their respective sectors of influence.

High Command, a popular term among the military forces of the TSFN and TSFMC, usually refers to the group of people in charge of commanding
the military arms of the [bold]Federation[/bold].

Central Command, or CentCom for short is a term usually used to refer to the civilian government of the TSF, however it may also be used to refer to High Command.

## Noteworthy Government Entities

- [bold]TSFN[/bold]: Trans-Solarian Federation Navy, the military arm of the TSF.
-- [bold]TSFMC[/bold]: Trans-Solarian Federation Marine Corps, serving as infantry for planetary combat or boarding troops.
-- [bold]TSFMP[/bold]: Trans-Solarian Federation Marine Police. While still serving under the TSFN they have an unique authority, as in that every member of the MP serves technically independently and does not have to follow orders outside of the TSFMP.

- [bold]TSFSC[/bold]: Trans-Solarian Federation Science Cabinet, responsible for all scientific ventures in the Federation, which is anything between applied and theoretical sciences (bluespace-related and regular) to research of tactics for ground-based and space warfare.
