### Colossus Sector, First Contact Event 01-COLOSSUS

2318: [bold]The Colossus sector,[/bold] a 'high-value sector' as phrased by the UNE before their collapse is surveyed by TSF research vessels, discovering many anomalies.

- The [bold]Colossus sector's[/bold] passive Bluespace fluctuations are 13.37% above baseline. While not in any way lethal to biological life, it means that the sector has a large amount of plasma and bluespace crystal deposits… with [italic]occasional[/italic] Bluespace anomalies.
- Many small and mid-size frigates and fighters of unknown design and origins are detected on radar and mass scanner consoles by survey ships; transponder readings are somehow compatible with TSF hardware, identified as “ADS”. While harmless on their own, when provoked via continued observation or presence in their 'patrol areas' (as designated by science personnel) the ships react with lethal force.
-- In [bold]TSFSC Incident #003-COLOSSUS[/bold], an ADS ship (furthermore designated as A1 in document) opened fire on a survey ship after following it for a period of more than 21 standard-cycle minutes.
