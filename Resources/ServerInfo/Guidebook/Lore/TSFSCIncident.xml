# Trans-Solarian Federation Science Cabinet
## Incident #003-COLOSSUS

- A1 opened fire almost immediately when in target field of view, the survey ship was annihilated almost instantly while the energy readings of the weaponry onboard A1 seemed at first as sensor malfunction.
- The weaponry of A1, while not completely alien and beyond understanding, was thought to previously be only theoretical by the greatest minds in the A&TS department and ATBA sub-department respectively.
- After this incident, all ADS forces are to be considered hostile upon discovery to preserve public safety. TSFN units are incentivized to attempt minimal damage to ADS spacecraft to advance scientific affairs, however if this approach is deemed unavailable the responder will not be subject to any scrutiny.
-- Survey ships when attempting to leave the Colossus sector to relay information back to scientists in the Sol system were suddenly attacked by seemingly autonomous droneships utilizing ramming and suicidal attacks, luckily a nearby military patrol saved them just in time, the science fleet escaping with only crew injuries and heavy hull damage.
-- In an after action report, science personnel aboard the attacked ships reported that the droneships exhibited completely different behavior from ADS spacecraft while also differing in shape and color. This most likely means that the droneships and ADS respectively come from different sources.
